# Testing

Testing is currently WIP.  Until packaging is complete, dependancy resolution is not fully functional.  

To run existing tests,  use the following from the main folder of the repo.

```python
import vminfo_parser
from tests.main_class_test import TestVMInfoParser, unittest
unittest.main()
```

Alternatively, assuming all requirements files are sourced

```python
pytest
```

will properly load and run the tests.
